            <p>Frontrooms are the current world/dimension you live in, in which nothing unordinary happens. So unless you have been put in an unexplored backrooms level with a wifi access, you are in the frontrooms.</p>
            <p><i>
                The Frontrooms are considered the major counterpart to the Backrooms.
            </i></p>
            <p><b>Explore the frontrooms</b></p>
            <p>You have most likely explored a lot of the frontrooms just by living in them, even though only 35% of the whole planet Earth, or as called right now "the frontrooms" has actually been explored by humans.</p>
            <p>If you want to explore other parts of the planet Earth, go on, it may not be as difficult as you imagine it...</p>
            <h2>Bored of the frontrooms? Explore the backrooms!</h2>
